# Advent Of Code 2025
Repository to hold my solutions to the Advent of Code puzzles for 2025 (https://adventofcode.com/2025).

## Puzzle 01

Manually save the input data from [https://adventofcode.com/2025/day/1/input](https://adventofcode.com/2025/day/1/input) into a csv file at /puzzle_01/input/INPUT.csv with the field name of INPUT.

Output is automatically saved in /puzzle_01/output/output_data_XX.csv and /puzzle_01/output/password_XX.txt where XX is the part of the puzzle being soved (either 01 or 02).

Requires magrittr and here libraries for modulus function and relative file paths.
